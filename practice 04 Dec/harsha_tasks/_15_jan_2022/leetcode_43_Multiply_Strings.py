43. Multiply Strings
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
Example 1:
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"

Example 2:
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"

"""Approach: The idea is to use the ASCII value of the digits from 0 to 9 start from 48 â€“ 57.
Therefore, to change the numeric character to an integer subtract 48 from 
the ASCII value of the character will give the corresponding digit for the given character."""
